## About the site

This code repository supports a rebuilding project of the Digital Preservation Workshop website. Specifically, this project attempts to build a fresh copy of the site using Drupal 8.

For now, this is a work in progress.

## About the tooling

This repository can be deployed on Pantheon via the Circle CI service, following the instructions in Pantheon's [Build Tools](https://pantheon.io/docs/guides/build-tools/) tutorial. It leverages the Terminus and Composer CLI tools, as well as unit tests from Behat and code linting on Circle CI.

The badges at the top of this page will take you to the relevant resources and the running website.
